#
# Entries below are records of source IP addresses that have been
# identified as an open IPv4 protocol 41 relay (i.e. IPv6 over IPv4).
# To read more about the IPv4 protocol feed see:
#
#   <https://dataplane.org/jtk/blog/2020/12/prot41-feed/>
#
# Each entry is sorted according to a route originating ASN.  An entry
# for the IP address is listed only once even if there are multiple
# origin AS (MOAS) announcements for the covering prefix.  We use the
# PyASN IP address to ASN mapping service to construct an origin AS
# number and name.  For details about PyASN, see:
#
#   <https://pypi.org/project/pyasn/>.
#
# The report format is as follows:
#
# ASN  |  ASname  |  ipaddr  |  firstseen  |  lastseen  |  category
#
# Each field is described below.  Please note any special formatting
# rules to aid in processing this file with automated tools and scripts.
# Blank lines may be present to improve the visual display of this file.
# Lines beginning with a hash ('#') character are comment lines.  All
# other lines are report entries.  Each field is separated by a pipe
# symbol ('|') and at least two whitespace characters on either side.
#
#   ASN        Autonomous system number originating a route for the
#              entry IP address. Note, 4-byte ASNs are supported and
#              will be displayed as a 32-bit integer.  NA is shown if
#              an origin ASN cannot be found.
#
#   ASname     A descriptive network name for the associated ASN.  The
#              name is truncated to 30 characters.  NA is shown if an
#              AS name cannot be found.
#
#   ipaddr     The IPv4 address that is being reported.
#
#   firstseen  A first seen timestamp formatted as YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS
#              in UTC time.
#
#   lastseen   A last seen timestamp formatted as YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS
#              in UTC time.
#
#   category   Descriptive tag name for this entry.  For this report,
#              the text proto41 will appear.
#
# A commented footer section shows an aggregate count of ASNs and
# addresses seen in the current report.
