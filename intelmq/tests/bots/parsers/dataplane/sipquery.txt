# Entries below consist of fields with identifying characteristics of a
# a source IP address that has been seen initiating a SIP OPTIONS query
# to a remote host.  This report lists hosts that are suspicious of more
# than just port scanning.  These hosts may be SIP server cataloging or
# conducting various forms of telephony abuse.  Each entry is sorted
# according to a route origination ASN.  An entry for the IP address may
# be listed more than once if there are multiple origin AS (MOAS)
# announcements for the covering prefix.  We use the Team Cymru IP
# address to ASN mapping service to construct an origin AS number and
# name.  For details about this Team Cymru service, see:

# The report format is as follows:
