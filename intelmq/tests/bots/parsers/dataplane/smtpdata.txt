# identified as SMTP clients sending DATA commands.

#
# Each entry is sorted according to a route originating ASN.  An entry
# for the IP address is listed only once even if there are multiple
# origin AS (MOAS) announcements for the covering prefix.  We use the
# PyASN IP address to ASN mapping service to construct an origin AS
# number and name.  For details about PyASN, see:
#
#   <https://pypi.org/project/pyasn/>.
#
# The report format is as follows:
#
# ASN  |  ASname  |  ipaddr  |  lastseen  |  category
