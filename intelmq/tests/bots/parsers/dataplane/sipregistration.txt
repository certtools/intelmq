# Entries below consist of fields with identifying characteristics of a
# a source IP address that has been seen initiating a SIP REGISTER
# operation to a remote host.  This report lists hosts that are
# suspicious of more than just port scanning.  These hosts may be SIP
# client cataloging or conducting various forms of telephony abuse.
# Each entry is sorted according to a route origination ASN.  An entry
# for the IP address may be listed more than once if there are multiple
# origin AS (MOAS) announcements for the covering prefix.  We use the
# Team Cymru IP address to ASN mapping service to construct an origin AS
# number and name.  For details about this Team Cymru service, see:
