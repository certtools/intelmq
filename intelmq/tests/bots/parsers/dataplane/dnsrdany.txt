# Entries below are records of source IP addresses that have been
# identified as sending recursive DNS IN ANY queries.
# Each entry is sorted according to a route originating ASN.  An entry
# for the IP address is listed only once even if there are multiple
# origin AS (MOAS) announcements for the covering prefix.  We use the
# PyASN IP address to ASN mapping service to construct an origin AS
# number and name.  For details about PyASN, see:
#
#   <https://pypi.org/project/pyasn/>.
#
# The report format is as follows:
#
# ASN  |  ASname  |  ipaddr  |  lastseen  |  category
#
# Each field is described below.  Please note any special formatting
# rules to aid in processing this file with automated tools and scripts.

#              an origin ASN cannot be found.
#
#   ASname     A descriptive network name for the associated ASN.  The
#              name is truncated to 30 characters.  NA is shown if an
