a growing level of persistence, and acts ever more aggressively in terms of
attack method. We also found that recent publications on the group’s activity
have done nothing to change their behavior or reduce their activity. They don’t
seem to bother to have to “disappear.” With this paper, we feel fairly certain
that Rocket Kitten’s prime targets are not companies and political
organizations as entire bodies but individuals that operate in strategically
interesting fields such as diplomacy, foreign policy research, and
defense-related businesses. We believe the espionage factor and political
context make their attacks unique and very different from traditional targeted
attacks.""".replace('\n', ' '),
