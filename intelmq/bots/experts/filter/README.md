### Filter Bot

Bot allowing out specific events

Parameters for filtering with key/value attributes:
* filter_key - key from data harmonization
* filter_value - value for the key
* filter_action - action when a message match to the criteria (possible actions: keep/drop)

Parameters for time based filtering:
* not_before - events before this time will be dropped
* not_after - events after this time will be dropped

Both parameters accept string values describing absolute or relative time:
* absolute
 * basically anything parsable by datetime parser, eg. "2015-09-012T06:22:11+00:00"
 * time.source taken from the event will be compared to this value to decide the filter behavior
* relative
 * accepted string formatted like this "<integer> <epoch>", where epoch could be any of following strings (could optionally end with trailing 's'): hour, day, week, month, year
 * time.source taken from the event will be compared to the value (now - relative) to decide the filter behavior

Examples of time filter definition:
* ```"not_before" : "2015-09-012T06:22:11+00:00"``` events older than the specified time will be dropped
* ```"not_after" : "6 months"``` just events older than 6 months will be passed through the pipeline
