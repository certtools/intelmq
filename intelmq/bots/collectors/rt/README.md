Request Tracker collector
=========================

You need the rt-library from nic.cz, available via [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rt):

    pip install rt

Version 1.0.9 is required, as older version have bugs.

This rt bot will connect to RT and inspect the given `search_queue` for tickets matching all criteria in `search_*`, 
Any matches will be inspected. For each match, all (RT-) attachments of the matching RT tickets are iterated over and within this loop, the first matching filename in the attachment is processed.
If none of the filename matches apply, the contents of the first (RT-) "history" item is matched against the URL-regex.

## Configuration

### Search

The parameters prefixed with `search_` allow configuring the ticket search.

Empty strings and `null` as value for search parameters are ignored.

### File downloads

Attachments can be optionally unzipped, remote files are downloaded with the `http_*` settings applied (see `defaults.conf`).

If `url_regex` or `attachment_regex` are empty strings, false or null, they are ignored.

### Ticket processing

Optionally, the RT bot can "take" RT tickets (i.e. the `user` is assigned this ticket now) and/or the status can be changed (leave `set_status` empty in case you don't want to change the status). Please note however that you **MUST** do one of the following: either "take" the ticket  or set the status (`set_status`). Otherwise, the search will find the ticket every time and we will have generated an endless loop.

In case a resource needs to be fetched and this resource is permanently not available (status code is 4xx), the ticket status will be set according to the configuration to avoid processing the ticket over and over.
For temporary failures the status is not modified, instead the ticket will be skipped in this run.

### Example

    "request-tracker-collector": {
        "attachment_regex": "\\.csv\\.zip$",
        "feed": "Request Tracker",
        "password": "intelmq",
        "search_not_older_than": null,
        "search_owner": "nobody",
        "search_queue": "Incident Reports",
        "search_requestor": null,
        "search_status": "new",
        "search_subject_like": "Report",
        "set_status": "open",
        "take_ticket": true,
        "rate_limit": 3600,
        "url_regex": "https://dl.shadowserver.org/[a-zA-Z0-9?_-]*",
        "uri": "http://localhost/rt/REST/1.0",
        "user": "intelmq",
        "unzip_attachment": true
    },

## Time search

To find only tickets newer than a given absolute or relative time, you can use the `search_not_older_than` parameter. Absolute time specification can be anything parseable by dateutil, best use a ISO format.

Relative must be in this format: `[number] [timespan]s`, e.g. `3 days`. Timespan can be hour, day, week, month, year. Trailing 's' is supported for all timespans. Relative times are subtracted from the current time directly before the search is performed.
