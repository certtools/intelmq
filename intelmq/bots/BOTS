These domains names are usually registered and operated by cybercriminals for the exclusive purpose of hosting a Feodo botnet controller. Hence you should expect no legit traffic to those domains. I highly recommend you to block/drop any traffic towards any Feodo C&C domain by using the Feodo Domain Blocklist. Please consider that domain names are usually only used by version B of the Feodo Trojan. C&C communication channels used by version A, version C and version D are not covered by this blocklist.",

Attention: Since Feodo C&C servers associated with version A, version C and version D are usually hosted on compromised servers, its likely that you also block/drop legit traffic e.g. towards websites hosted on a certain IP address acting as Feodo C&C for version A, version C and version D.
