The value of the taxonomy key is thus a derivative of the dynamic type above.

In contrast with the static taxonomy below, the dynamic typing is used to perform business decisions in the abuse handling pipeline. Furthermore, the value data set should be kept as minimal as possible to avoid \u201ctype explosion\u201d, which in turn dilutes the business value of the dynamic typing.
