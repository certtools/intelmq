CHANGELOG
==========

1.1.0 (unreleased)
------------------
- Support for Python 3.3 has been dropped, it reached its end of life.
- The list of feeds docs/Feeds.md has now a machine-readable equivalent YAML file in intelmq/etc/feeds.yaml
  A tool to convert from yaml to md has been added.
  This is not an executable part of packages, only relevant for developers.

### Tools
- `intelmqctl start` prints bot's error messages if it failed to start
- `intelmqctl check` checks for defaults.conf completeness
- `intelmqctl check` shows errors for non-importable bots.
- `intelmqctl list bots -q` only prints the IDs of enabled bots
- `intelmq_gen_feeds_docs` add to bin directory, allows generating the Feeds.md documentation file from feeds.yaml

### Contrib
- contrib tool `feeds-config-generator` to automatically generate the collector and parser runtime and pipeline configurations.

### Core
- use SIGTERM instead of SIGINT to stop bots (#981)
- Subitems in fields of type `JSONDict` (see below) can be accessed directly. E.g. you can do:
  event['extra.foo'] = 'bar'
  event['extra.foo'] # gives 'bar'
  It is still possible to set and get the field as whole, however this may be removed or changed in the future:
  event['extra'] = '{"foo": "bar"}'
  event['extra'] # gives '{"foo": "bar"}'
  "Old" bots and configurations compatible with 1.0.x do still work.
  Also, the extra field is now properly exploded when exporting events, analogous to all other fields.
- intelmq.lib.message.Message.add: The parameter overwrite accepts now three different values: True, False and None (new).
  True: An existing value will be overwritten
  False: An existing value will not be overwritten (previously and exception has been raised when the value was raised).
  None (default): If the value exists an KeyExists Exception is thrown (previously the same as False).
  This allows shorter code in the bots, as an 'overwrite' configuration parameter can be directly passed to the function.
- Bots can specify a static method `check(parameters)` which can perform individual checks specific to the bot.
  These functions will be called by `intelmqctl check` if the bot is configured with the given parameters
- Add `RewindableFileHandle` to utils making handling of CSV files more easy (optionally)

### Bots
#### Collectors
- Mail:
  - New parameters; `sent_from`: filter messages by sender, `sent_to`: filter messages by recipient
  - More debug logs
- bots.experts.maxmind_geoip: New (optional) parameter `overwrite`, by default false. The current default was to overwrite!
- `bots.collectors.n6.collector_stomp`: renamed to `bots.collectors.stomp.collector` (#716)
- bots.collectors.rt:
  - New parameter `search_requestor` to search for field Requestor.
  - Empty strings and `null` as value for search parameters are ignored.
  - Empty parameters `attachment_regex` and `url_regex` handled.
- `bots.collectors.http.collector_http`: Ability to optionally use the current time in parameter `http_url`, added parameter `http_url_formatting`.
- bots.collectors.stomp.collectos: Heartbeat timeout is now logged with log level info instead of warning.

#### Parsers
- changed feednames in `bots.parsers.shadowserver`. Please refer to it's README for the exact changes.
- shadowserver parser: If the conversion function fails for a line, an error is raised and the offending line will be handled according to the error handling configuration.
  Previouly errors like these were only logged and ignored otherwise.
- added destination.urlpath and source.urlpath to harmonization.
- changed feednames in `bots.parsers.shadowserver`. Please refer to it's README for the exact changes.
- The Generic CSV Parser `bots.parsers.generic.parser_csv`:
  - It is possible to filter the data before processing them using the new parameters `filter_type` and `filter_text`.
  - It is possible to specify multiple coulmns using `|` character in parameter `columns`.
  - The parameter `time_format` now supports `'epoch_millis'` for seconds since the Epoch, milliseconds are supported but not used.
- renamed `bots.parsers.cymru_full_bogons.parser` to `bots.parsers.cymru.parser_full_bogons`, compatibility shim will be removed in version 2.0
- added `bots.parsers.cymru.parser_cap_program`
- added `intemq.bots.parsers.zoneh.parser` for ZoneH feeds
- added `intemq.bots.parsers.sucuri.parser`
- added `intemq.bots.parsers.malwareurl.parser`

#### Experts
- Added sieve expert for filtering and modifying events (#1083)

### Harmonization
- Renamed `JSON` to `JSONDict` and added a new type `JSON`. `JSONDict` saves data internally as JSON, but acts like a dictionary. `JSON` accepts any valid JSON.
- fixed regex for `protocol.transport` it previously allowed more values than it should have.
- New ASN type. Like integer but checks the range.

### Requirements
- Requests is no longer listed as dependency of the core. For depending bots the requirement is noted in their REQUIREMENTS.txt file

2016/06/18
----------

* improvements in pipeline:
  - PipelineFactory to give possibility to easily add a new broker (Redis, ZMQ, etc..)
  - Splitter feature: if this option is enable, will split the events in source queue to multiple destination queues
* add different messages support:
  - the system is flexible to define a new type of message like 'tweet' without change anything in bot.py, pipeline.py. Just need to add a new class in message.py and harmonization.conf
* add harmonization support
  - in harmonization.conf is possible to define the fields of a specific message in json format.
  - the harmonization.py has data types witch contains sanitize and validation methods that will make sure that the values are correct to be part of an event.
* Error Handling
 - multiple parameters in configuration which gives possibility to define how bot will handle some errors. Example of parameters:
   - `error_procedure` - retry or pass in case of error
   - `error_retry_delay` - time in seconds to retry
   - `error_max_retries` - number of retries
   - `error_log_message` - log or not the message in error log
   - `error_log_exception` - log or not the exception in error log
   - `error_dump_message` - log or not the message in dump log to be fixed and re-insert in pipeline
* Exceptions
  - custom exceptions for IntelMQ
* Defaults configurations
  - new configuration file to specify the default parameters which will be applied to all bots. Bots can overwrite the configurations.
* New bots/feeds


2015/06/03 (aaron)
------------------

  * fixed the license to AGPL in setup.py
  * moved back the documentation from the wiki repo to `docs/`. See #205.
  * added python-zmq as a setup requirement in UserGuide . See #206
