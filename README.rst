**IntelMQ** is a solution for IT security teams (CERTs & CSIRTs, SOCs, abuse
departments, etc.) for collecting and processing security feeds (such as
log files) using a message queuing protocol. It's a community driven
initiative called **IHAP** (Incident Handling Automation Project) which
was conceptually designed by European CERTs/CSIRTs during several
InfoSec events. Its main goal is to give to incident responders an easy
way to collect & process threat intelligence thus improving the incident
handling processes of CERTs.

Several pieces of software are evolved around IntelMQ. For an overview,
look at the `Ecosystem document  <docs/Ecosystem.md>`__.

IntelMQ can be used for
- automated incident handling
- situational awareness
- automated notifications
- as data collector for other tools
- etc.

IntelMQ's design was influenced by
`AbuseHelper <https://github.com/abusesa/abusehelper>`__ however it was
re-written from scratch and aims at:

-  Reducing the complexity of system administration
-  Reducing the complexity of writing new bots for new data feeds
-  Reducing the probability of events lost in all process with
   persistence functionality (even system crash)
-  Use and improve the existing Data Harmonization Ontology
-  Use JSON format for all messages
-  Provide easy way to store data into Log Collectors like
   ElasticSearch, Splunk, databases (such as PostgreSQL)
-  Provide easy way to create your own black-lists
-  Provide easy communication with other systems via HTTP RESTful API

It follows the following basic meta-guidelines:

-  Don't break simplicity - KISS
-  Keep it open source - forever
-  Strive for perfection while keeping a deadline
-  Reduce complexity/avoid feature bloat
-  Embrace unit testing
-  Code readability: test with unexperienced programmers
-  Communicate clearly

How to Install
--------------

See `INSTALL <docs/INSTALL.md>`__.

User Guide
----------

See `User Guide <docs/User-Guide.md>`__.
Which Feeds are supported? Have a look at the `Feeds documentation <docs/Feeds.md>`__ and the `Bots documentation <docs/Bots.md>`__.
If you know additional feeds and how to parse them, please contribute your code or your configuration (by issues or the mailing lists).

For support questions please use the intelmq-users mailing list:
https://lists.cert.at/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/intelmq-users

IntelMQ use the Data Harmonization. Please read `this
document <docs/Data-Harmonization.md>`__ for more details.

IntelMQ Manager and more tools
------------------------------

Check out this graphical
`tool <https://github.com/certtools/intelmq-manager>`__ and easily
manage an IntelMQ system.

More tools can be found in the `ecosystem documentation <docs/Ecosystem.md>`__.

How to participate
