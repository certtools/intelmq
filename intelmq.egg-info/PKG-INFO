Description: Welcome to IntelMQ!

        **IntelMQ** is a solution for IT security teams (CERTs & CSIRTs, SOCs, abuse
        departments, etc.) for collecting and processing security feeds (such as
        log files) using a message queuing protocol. It's a community driven
        initiative called **IHAP** (Incident Handling Automation Project) which
        was conceptually designed by European CERTs/CSIRTs during several
        InfoSec events. Its main goal is to give to incident responders an easy
        way to collect & process threat intelligence thus improving the incident
        handling processes of CERTs.
        
        Several pieces of software are evolved around IntelMQ. For an overview,
        look at the `Ecosystem document  <https://github.com/certtools/intelmq/blob/master/docs/Ecosystem.md>`__.
        
        IntelMQ can be used for
        - automated incident handling
        - situational awareness
        - automated notifications
        - as data collector for other tools
        - etc.
        
        IntelMQ's design was influenced by
        `AbuseHelper <https://github.com/abusesa/abusehelper>`__ however it was
        re-written from scratch and aims at:
        
        -  Reducing the complexity of system administration
        -  Reducing the complexity of writing new bots for new data feeds
        -  Reducing the probability of events lost in all process with
           persistence functionality (even system crash)
        -  Use and improve the existing Data Harmonization Ontology
        -  Use JSON format for all messages
        -  Provide easy way to store data into Log Collectors like
           ElasticSearch, Splunk, databases (such as PostgreSQL)
        -  Provide easy way to create your own black-lists
        -  Provide easy communication with other systems via HTTP RESTful API
        
        It follows the following basic meta-guidelines:
        
        -  Don't break simplicity - KISS
        -  Keep it open source - forever
        -  Strive for perfection while keeping a deadline
        -  Reduce complexity/avoid feature bloat
        -  Embrace unit testing
        -  Code readability: test with unexperienced programmers
        -  Communicate clearly
