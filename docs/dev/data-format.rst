Data Format

Overview
========

In IntelMQ version 3.x+ the internal data format name changed from DHO ( IntelMQ Data Harmonization ) to IDF ( IntelMQ Data Format ).
The python module `intelmq.lib.harmonization` and the configuration file `harmonization.conf` keep the name `harmonization` for now. DHO and IDF have the same meaning.

All messages (reports and events) are Python/JSON dictionaries. The key names and according types are defined by the IntelMQ Data Format.

The purpose of this document is to list and clearly define known **fields** in Abusehelper as well as IntelMQ or similar systems.
A field is a ```key=value``` pair. For a clear and unique definition of a field, we must define the **key** (field-name) as well as the possible **values**.
A field belongs to an **event**. An event is basically a structured log record in the form ```key=value, key=value, key=value, â€¦```.
In the :ref:`List of known fields <data format field list>`, each field is grouped by a **section**. We describe these sections briefly below.
Every event **MUST** contain a timestamp field.

An `IOC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_of_compromise>`_ (Indicator of compromise) is a single observation like a log line.

Rules for keys
==============

The keys can be grouped together in sub-fields, e.g. `source.ip` or `source.geolocation.latitude`.

Only the lower-case alphabet, numbers and the underscore are allowed. Further, the field name must not begin with a number.
Thus, keys must match ``^[a-z_][a-z_0-9]+(\.[a-z_0-9]+)*$``.
These rules also apply for the otherwise unregulated ``extra.`` namespace.


Sections
========

As stated above, every field is organized under some section. The following is a description of the sections and what they imply.

Feed
----

Fields listed under this grouping list details about the source feed where information came from.

Time
----

The time section lists all fields related to time information.
This document requires that all the timestamps MUST be normalized to UTC. If the source reports only a date, do not attempt to invent timestamps.

Source Identity
---------------

This section lists all fields related to identification of the source. The source is the identity the IoC is about, as opposed to the destination identity, which is another identity.

For examples see the table below.

The abuse type of an event defines the way these events needs to be interpreted. For example, for a botnet drone they refer to the compromised machine, whereas for a command and control server they refer the server itself.

Source Geolocation Identity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recognize that ip geolocation is not an exact science and analysis of the abuse data has shown that different sources attribution sources have different opinions of the geolocation of an ip. This is why we recommend to enrich the data with as many sources as you have available and make the decision which value to use for the cc IOC based on those answers.

Source Local Identity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some sources report an internal (NATed) IP address.

Destination Identity
--------------------

The abuse type of an event defines the way these IOCs needs to be interpreted. For a botnet drone they refer to the compromised machine, whereas for a command and control server they refer the server itself.

Destination Geolocation Identity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recognize that ip geolocation is not an exact science and analysis of the abuse data has shown that different sources attribution sources have different opinions of the geolocation of an ip. This is why we recommend to enrich the data with as many sources as you have available and make the decision which value to use for the cc IOC based on those answers.

Destination Local Identity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some sources report an internal (NATed) IP address.

Extra values
------------
Data which does not fit in the format can be saved in the 'extra' namespace. All keys must begin with `extra.`, there are no other rules on key names and values. The values can be get/set like all other fields.

.. _data format classification:

Classification
==============

IntelMQ classifies events using three labels: taxonomy, type and identifier. This tuple of three values can be used for deduplication of events and describes what happened.

The taxonomy can be automatically added by the taxonomy expert bot based on the given type. The following classification scheme follows the `Reference Security Incident Taxonomy (RSIT) <https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force/>`_:


===============================  ========================================= =============================================
      Taxonomy                   Type                                        Description

   intrusion-attempts            ids-alert                                   IOCs based on a sensor network. This is a generic IOC denomination, should it be difficult to reliably denote the exact type of activity involved for example due to an anecdotal nature of the rule that triggered the alert.
   intrusions                    application-compromise                      Compromise of an application by exploiting (un)known software vulnerabilities, e.g. SQL injection.

   other                         blacklist                                   Some sources provide blacklists, which clearly refer to abusive behavior, such as spamming, but fail to denote the exact reason why a given identity has been blacklisted. The reason may be that the justification is anecdotal or missing entirely. This type should only be used if the typing fits the definition of a blacklist, but an event specific denomination is not possible for one reason or another. Not in RSIT.

   other                         other                                       All incidents which don't fit in one of the given categories should be put into this class.

   other                         undetermined                                The categorisation of the incident is unknown/undetermined.

In the "other" taxonomy, several types are not in the RSIT, but this taxonomy is intentionally extensible.

Meaning of source and destination identities
--------------------------------------------

Meaning of source and destination identities for each classification type and possible ``classification.identifier`` meanings and usages. The identifier is often a normalized malware name, grouping many variants or the affected network protocol.
Examples of the meaning of the *source* and *destination* fields for each classification type and possible identifiers are shown here. Usually the main information is in the *source* fields. The identifier is often a normalized malware name, grouping many variants.

Field in italics is the interesting one for CERTs.

Example:

If you know of an IP address that connects to a zeus c&c server, it's about the infected device, thus `classification.taxonomy` is *malicious-code*, `classification.type` is *infected-system* and the `classification.identifier` is zeus. If you want to complain about the c&c server, the event's `classification.type` is *c2server*. The `malware.name` can have the full name, eg. `zeus_p2p`.

Minimum recommended requirements for events
===========================================

Below, we have enumerated the minimum recommended requirements for an actionable abuse event. These keys should to be present for the abuse report to make sense for the end recipient. Please note that if you choose to anonymize your sources, you can substitute **feed** with **feed.code** and that only one of the identity keys **ip**, **domain name**, **url**, **email address** must be present. All the rest of the keys are **optional**.
