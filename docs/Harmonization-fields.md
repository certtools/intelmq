Harmonization field names
=========================

|Section|Name|Type|Description|
|:------|:---|:---|:----------|
|Classification|classification.identifier|String|The lowercase identifier defines the actual software or service (e.g. 'heartbleed' or 'ntp_version') or standardized malware name (e.g. 'zeus').|
|Classification|classification.taxonomy|String|We recognize the need for the CSIRT teams to apply a static (incident) taxonomy to abuse data. With this goal in mind the type IOC will serve as a basis for this activity. Each value of the dynamic type mapping translates to a an element in the static taxonomy. The European CSIRT teams for example have decided to apply the eCSIRT.net incident classification. The value of the taxonomy key is thus a derivative of the dynamic type above. For more information about check [ENISA taxonomies](http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management/browsable/incident-handling-process/incident-taxonomy/existing-taxonomies).|
|Classification|classification.type|ClassificationType|The abuse type IOC is one of the most crucial pieces of information for any given abuse event. The main idea of dynamic typing is to keep our ontology flexible, since we need to evolve with the evolving threatscape of abuse data. In contrast with the static taxonomy below, the dynamic typing is used to perform business decisions in the abuse handling pipeline. Furthermore, the value data set should be kept as minimal as possible to avoid “type explosion”, which in turn dilutes the business value of the dynamic typing. In general, we normally have two types of abuse type IOC: ones referring to a compromized resource or ones referring to pieces of the criminal infrastructure, such as a command and control servers for example.|
||comment|String|Free text commentary about the abuse event inserted by an analyst.|
|Destination|destination.abuse_contact|String|Abuse contact for destination address. A comma separated list.|

|Destination Geolocation|destination.geolocation.city|String|Some geolocation services refer to city-level geolocation.|

||event_hash|String|Computed event hash with specific keys and values that identify a unique event. At present, the hash should default to using the SHA1 function. Please note that for an event hash to be able to match more than one event (deduplication) the receiver of an event should calculate it based on a minimal set of keys and values present in the event. Using for example the observation time in the calculation will most likely render the checksum useless for deduplication purposes.|
