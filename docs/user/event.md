# Event

An event represents individual piece of data processed by IntelMQ. It uses JSON format.

Example Event:

```json

    "source.geolocation.cc": "JO",
    "malware.name": "qakbot",
    "source.ip": "82.212.115.188",
    "source.asn": 47887,
    "classification.type": "c2-server",
    "extra.status": "offline",

```

## Minimum Requirements

Below, we have enumerated the minimum recommended requirements for an actionable abuse event. These keys should be
present for the abuse report to make sense for the end recipient. Please note that if you choose to anonymize your
sources, you can substitute **feed.name** with **feed.code**. At least one of the fields **ip**, **fqdn**, **url** or **account** should be present. All the rest of the keys are optional. This list of required fields is *not* enforced by IntelMQ.

| Field                   | Terminology |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| feed.name               | Should      |
| classification.type     | Should      |
| classification.taxonomy | Should      |
| time.source             | Should      |
| time.observation        | Should      |
| source.ip               | Should\*    |
| source.fqdn             | Should\*    |
| source.url              | Should\*    |
| source.account          | Should\*    |

\* at least one of them

## Classification

IntelMQ classifies events using three labels: `classification.taxonomy`, `classification.type` and `classification.identifier`. This tuple of three values can be used for deduplication of events and describes what happened.

The taxonomy can be automatically added by the taxonomy expert bot based on the given type. The following classification scheme loosely follows the [Reference Security Incident Taxonomy (RSIT)](https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force/):

| Classification Taxonomy | Classification Type | Description |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| abusive-content      | harmful-speech       | Discreditation or discrimination of somebody, cyber stalking, racism or threats against one or more individuals.  |
| abusive-content      | spam                 |   Or 'Unsolicited Bulk Email', this means that the recipient has not granted verifiable permission for the message to be sent and that the message is sent as part of a larger collection of messages, all having a functionally comparable content. |
|   abusive-content    | violence             |   Child pornography, glorification of violence, etc.     |
|   availability       | ddos                 |   Distributed Denial of Service attack, e.g. SYN-Flood or UDP-based reflection/amplification attacks.           |

| other              | blacklist            | Some sources provide blacklists, which clearly refer to abusive behavior, such as spamming, but fail to denote the exact reason why a given identity has been blacklisted. The reason may be that the justification is anecdotal or missing entirely. This type should only be used if the typing fits the definition of a blacklist, but an event specific denomination is not possible for one reason or another. Not in RSIT.              |
| other              | dga-domain           | DGA Domains are seen various families of malware that are used to periodically generate a large number of domain names that can be used as rendezvous points with their command and control servers. Not in RSIT.       |

## Meaning of source and destination identities

Meaning of source and destination identities for each `classification.type` can be different. Usually the main information is in the `source.*` fields.

The `classification.identifier` is often a normalized malware name, grouping many variants or the affected network protocol.

Examples of the meaning of the *source* and *destination* fields for various `classification.type` and possible identifiers are shown here.

| Classification Type   | Source                                 | Destination          | Possible Identifiers                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| blacklist             | blacklisted device                     |                      |                                      |

Examples:

- If an event describes IP address that connects to a zeus command and control server, it's about the infected device. Therefore the `classification.taxonomy` is `malicious-code`, `classification.type` is `infected-system` and the `classification.identifier` is `zeus`.

- If an event describes IP address where a command and control server is running, the event's
`classification.type` is `c2server`. The `malware.name` can have the full name, eg. `zeus_p2p`.
  
## Additional Information

Information that do not fit into any of the event fields should be placed in the `extra` namespace.Therefore the keys must be prefixed `extra.` string. There are no other rules on key names and values for additional information.

## Fields Reference

Here you can find detailed information about all the possible fields used in an event.


### `classification.identifier` <div id="classification.identifier" />

**Type:** [String](#string)

The lowercase identifier defines the actual software or service (e.g. ``heartbleed`` or ``ntp_version``) or standardized malware name (e.g. ``zeus``). Note that you MAY overwrite this field during processing for your individual setup. This field is not standardized across IntelMQ setups/users.

### `classification.taxonomy` <div id="classification.taxonomy" />

**Type:** [ClassificationTaxonomy](#classificationtaxonomy)

We recognize the need for the CSIRT teams to apply a static (incident) taxonomy to abuse data. With this goal in mind the type IOC will serve as a basis for this activity. Each value of the dynamic type mapping translates to a an element in the static taxonomy. The European CSIRT teams for example have decided to apply the eCSIRT.net incident classification. The value of the taxonomy key is thus a derivative of the dynamic type above. For more information about check `ENISA taxonomies <http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management/browsable/incident-handling-process/incident-taxonomy/existing-taxonomies>`_.

### `classification.type` <div id="classification.type" />

**Type:** [ClassificationType](#classificationtype)

The abuse type IOC is one of the most crucial pieces of information for any given abuse event. The main idea of dynamic typing is to keep our ontology flexible, since we need to evolve with the evolving threatscape of abuse data. In contrast with the static taxonomy below, the dynamic typing is used to perform business decisions in the abuse handling pipeline. Furthermore, the value data set should be kept as minimal as possible to avoid *type explosion*, which in turn dilutes the business value of the dynamic typing. In general, we normally have two types of abuse type IOC: ones referring to a compromised resource or ones referring to pieces of the criminal infrastructure, such as a command and control servers for example.
