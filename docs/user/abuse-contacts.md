# Abuse-contact look-ups

The right decision whom to contact about a specific incident is vital to get the incident resolved as quick as possible. Different types of events may required different abuse-contact to be selected. For example, issues about a device, e.g. a vulnerability in the operating system or an application, is better sent to the hoster which can inform the server administrator. For website-related issues, like defacements or phishing, the domain owner (maintaining the content of the website) could be the better and more direct contact. Additionally, different CERT's have different approaches and different contact databases. Multiple information sources have different information, and some sources are more accurate than others. IntelMQ can query multiple sources of abuse-contacts and combine them. Internal databases, like a Constituency Portal provide high-quality and first-hand contact information. The RIPE document [Sources of Abuse Contact Information for Abuse Handlers](https://www.ripe.net/publications/docs/ripe-658) contains a good summary of the complex of themes.

## Sources for abuse-contacts

All these bots add the queried contacts to the IntelMQ events in the field `source.abuse_contact` if not state otherwise in the documentation.

## Sources for domain-based abuse-contacts

These bots are suitable for domain-based abuse-contact look-ups.

- `intelmq.bots.experts.rdap.expert` expert queries private and public RDAP servers for `source.fqdn` and add the contact information to the event as `source.abuse_contact`.
- `intelmq.bots.experts.trusted_introducer_lookup.expert` expert queries a locally cached [Trusted Introducer team directory](https://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/teams.json) for the TLD or domain (first match) of `source.fqdn`.

## Sources for IP address-based abuse-contacts

These bots are suitable for IP address and ASN based abuse-contact look-ups.

- `intelmq.bots.experts.abusix.expert` expert queries the online Abusix service.
- `intelmq.bots.experts.do_portal.expert` expert queries an instance of the do-portal software (deprecated).
- `intelmq.bots.experts.tuency.expert` expert queries an instance of the **tuency** Constituency Portal for the IP address. The Portal also takes into account any notification rules, which are saved
  additionally in the event.
- `intelmq.bots.experts.ripe.expert` expert queries the online RIPE database for IP-Address and AS contacts.
- `intelmq.bots.experts.trusted_introducer_lookup.expert` expert queries a locally
  cached [Trusted Introducer team directory](https://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/teams.json)
  for the Autonomous system `source.asn`.

## Generic sources for abuse-contacts

- `intelmq.bots.experts.generic_db_lookup.expert` expert for local data sources, like
  database tables mapping ASNs to abuse-contact or Country Codes to abuse-contact.
- `intelmq.bots.experts.uwhoisd.expert` expert for fetching whois-data, not extracting
  abuse-contact information

## Helpful other bots for pre-processing

- `intelmq.bots.experts.asn_lookup.expert` queries locally cached database to lookup ASN.
- `intelmq.bots.experts.cymru_whois.expert` to lookup ASN, Geolocation, and BGP prefix
  for `*.ip`.
- `intelmq.bots.experts.domain_suffix.expert` to lookup the public suffix of the domain
  in `*.fqdn`.
- `intelmq.bots.experts.format_field.expert`
- `intelmq.bots.experts.gethostbyname.expert` resolve `*.ip` from `*.fqdn`.
- `intelmq.bots.experts.maxmind_geoip.expert` to lookup Geolocation information for `*.ip`
  .
- `intelmq.bots.experts.reverse_dns.expert` to resolve `*.reverse_dns` from `*.ip`.
- `intelmq.bots.experts.ripe.expert` to lookup `*.asn` and Geolocation information
  for `*.ip`.
- `intelmq.bots.experts.tor_nodes.expert` for filtering out TOR nodes.
- `intelmq.bots.experts.url2fqdn.expert` to extract `*.fqdn`/`*.ip` from `*.url`.

## Combining the lookup approaches

In order to get the best contact, it may be necessary to combine multiple abuse-contact sources. IntelMQ's modularity provides methods to arrange and configure the bots as needed. Among others, the following bots can help in getting the best result:

- `intelmq.bots.experts.filter.expert` Your lookup process may be different for different types of data. E.g. website-related issues may be better addressed at the domain owner and device-related issues may be better addressed to the hosting provider.
- `intelmq.bots.experts.modify.expert` Allows you to set values based on filter and also format values based on the value of other fields.
- `intelmq.bots.experts.sieve.expert` Very powerful expert which allows filtering, routing (to different subsequent bots) based on if-expressions . It support set-operations (field value is in list) as well as sub-network operations for IP address networks in CIDR notation for the expression-part. You can as well set the abuse-contact directly.
