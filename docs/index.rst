**IntelMQ** is a solution for IT security teams (CERTs & CSIRTs, SOCs abuse
departments, etc.) for collecting and processing security feeds (such as
log files) using a message queuing protocol. It's a community driven
initiative called **IHAP** (Incident Handling Automation Project) which
was conceptually designed by European CERTs/CSIRTs during several
InfoSec events. Its main goal is to give to incident responders an easy
way to collect & process threat intelligence thus improving the incident
handling processes of CERTs.
