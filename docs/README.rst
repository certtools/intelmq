   IntelMQ

|Build Status| |codecov.io|

**IntelMQ** is a solution for CERTs for collecting and processing
security feeds, pastebins, tweets and log files using a message queuing
protocol. It's a community driven initiative called **IHAP** (Incident
Handling Automation Project) which was conceptually designed by European
CERTs during several InfoSec events. Its main goal is to give to
incident responders an easy way to collect & process threat intelligence
thus improving the incident handling processes of CERTs.

IntelMQ's design was influenced by
`AbuseHelper <https://bitbucket.org/clarifiednetworks/abusehelper>`__,
however it was re-written from scratch and aims at:

-  Reduce the complexity of system administration
-  Reduce the complexity of writing new bots for new data feeds
-  Reduce the probability of events lost in all process with persistence
   functionality (even system crash)
-  Use and improve the existing Data Harmonization Ontology
-  Use JSON format for all messages
-  Integration of the existing tools (AbuseHelper, CIF)
-  Provide easy way to store data into Log Collectors like
   ElasticSearch, Splunk
-  Provide easy way to create your own black-lists
-  Provide easy communication with other systems via HTTP RESTFUL API

It follows the following basic meta-guidelines:

-  Don't break simplicity - KISS
-  Keep it open source - forever
-  Strive for perfection while keeping a deadline
-  Reduce complexity/avoid feature bloat
-  Embrace unit testing
-  Code readability: test with unexperienced programmers
-  Communicate clearly
