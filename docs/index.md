# Introduction

**IntelMQ** is a solution for IT security teams (CERTs & CSIRTs, SOCs
abuse departments, etc.) for collecting and processing security feeds
(such as log files) using a message queuing protocol. It's a community
driven initiative called **IHAP**[^1] (Incident Handling Automation Project)
which was conceptually designed by European CERTs/CSIRTs during several
InfoSec events. Its main goal is to give to incident responders an easy
way to collect & process threat intelligence thus improving the incident
handling processes of CERTs.

IntelMQ is frequently used for:

- automated incident handling
- situational awareness
- automated notifications
- as data collector for other tools
- and more!

The design was influenced by
[AbuseHelper](https://github.com/abusesa/abusehelper) however it was
re-written from scratch and aims at:

-   Reducing the complexity of system administration
-   Reducing the complexity of writing new bots for new data feeds
-   Reducing the probability of events lost in all process with persistence functionality (even system crash)
-   Use and improve the existing Data Harmonization Ontology
-   Use JSON format for all messages
-   Provide easy way to store data into databases and log collectors such as PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch and Splunk
-   Provide easy way to create your own black-lists
-   Provide easy communication with other systems via HTTP RESTful API

It follows the following basic meta-guidelines:

-   Don't break simplicity - KISS
-   Keep it open source - forever
-   Strive for perfection while keeping a deadline
-   Reduce complexity/avoid feature bloat
-   Embrace unit testing
-   Code readability: test with inexperienced programmers
-   Communicate clearly
